# Code run using the [train-SmatUNet.py](https://github.com/Dauriel/weather4cast2021/blob/main/utils/train-SmatUNet.py) file

# Example on how to train the model on Colab for the R1 region can be found here [demo_train_R1](https://github.com/Dauriel/weather4cast2021/blob/main/demo_train_R1.ipynb)

# To create a submission, run [submissions.py](https://github.com/Dauriel/weather4cast2021/blob/main/utils/submissions.py) with the corresponding checkpoints

# To generate an ensemble submission, first create a folder for each region (R1,R2,R3) and upload the corresponding checkpoints to be ensembled. Then run [submissions_ensemble.py](https://github.com/Dauriel/weather4cast2021/blob/main/utils/submissions_ensemble.py)
